 # Prerequsitories
# need a azure model
# need to setup azure textanalysis model endpoint, then need to create apikey

after setting up prerequistries ,use the model using node.js server
we need to enter the endpoint and apikey that we created in azure 
and using async getfunction we can get the language from client and 
then using the model that is available from azure we can detect the entered
language type.
